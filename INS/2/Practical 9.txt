Practical NO - 09

Aim: Malware Analysis and Detection
Analyze and identify malware samples using antivirus tools, analyze their behaviour, and develop counter measures to mitigate their impact.

The process for analyzing and detecting malware:

1) Obtaining Malware Samples
 --> Obtain malware samples from various sources such as honeypots, threat intelligence feeds or suspicious emails.

2) Isolating the Malware
 --> Set up a dedicated and isolated environment to analyze the malware safety.

3) Static Analysis
 --> Perform initial static analysis to understand the file's structure, strings and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

4) Dynamic Analysis
 --> Execute the malware in a controlled environment to observe it's behaviour.

5) Behavior Analysis
 --> Monitor the malware's behavior during execution to identify any malicious activities.

6) Code Reversing
 --> If the malware employs obfuscation or anti - analysis techniques, we code reversing techniques.

7) Signature Generation
 --> Based on the findings from the analysis, develop signature or patterns that can be used to detect and identify the malware in the future.

8) Reporting
 --> Document the findings and analysis results, including IOCs and signatures.

9) Mitigation and Remediation
 --> Develop counter measures and mitigation strategies to protect your systems from similar malware in the future.

10) Continuous Learning
 --> Stay updated with the latest malware trends, attack vectors and evasion techniques.
