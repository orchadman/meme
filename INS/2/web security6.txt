practical 6-----web security with ssl/tls configure & implement secure web communication using ssl/tls protocols

STEPS:

1--Obtain as SSL/TLS certificate
-- obtain an ssl/tls certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA).This certificate secures the web communication.

2--Install the certificate
--Generate a certificate singing request (CSR) submit it to the CA,recieve the signed certificate and then install ssl/tls certificate on the server.

3--Configure HTTPS on web server
--Update the server configuration to listen on the secure HTTPs port.

4--Enable SSL/TLS protocol
--Configure the web server to support the desired SSL/TLS protocols.

5--Configure Cipher Suiter
--Specify the supported cipher suites for SSL/TLS connections.

6--Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
--To ensure all web traffic is encrypted,set up a redirect from HTTP to HTTPs.

7--Test and Verify
--Test the SSL/TLS configuration by accessing the website using HTTPs.

8--Periodic Maintenance
--Regularly MOnitor and update the SSL/TLS configuration.
